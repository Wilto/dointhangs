I can no longer function in society without an issue tracker. So, I’m setting this one up to keep track of stuff—not website-stuff, but “here is a picture of a cool endtable that I want to build” stuff or “I need to buy a set of throttle cables for the bike” stuff.

I probably wouldn’t watch this repo too closely if I were you. It’s not gonna be particularly exciting.
